# Modelado predictivo

In this repository you have some Jupiter's notebooks with some practices from my class,  in "Primer Parcial" directory i did some algorithms without library like sklearn, o pythorch, you gonna see implementations using only libraries like numpy and pandas. 

En "Segundo Parcial" directory i did code in team with :
<ul>
  <li> <a href= 'https://github.com/DiegoGugo'> Diego Gugo</a> </li>
  <li> <a href = 'https://github.com/Iancaov06'> Ian Carrillo </a> </li>
  <li> Marco Serrano (I don't know if he has github) </li>
 </ul>
 

In this directory you gonna see a implementation of SVM, a implementation of KNN algorithm and implementation of Naive Bayes. That's very dificult but we did it without libraries like sklearn or pytorch,, you gonne see how we only use a numpy for implementations and some libraries for proccess natural languages.

In all directories you have a datasets if you gonna check or if you need it some implementation.

Some functions have documentations for your correct use (all functions tat I did it).
